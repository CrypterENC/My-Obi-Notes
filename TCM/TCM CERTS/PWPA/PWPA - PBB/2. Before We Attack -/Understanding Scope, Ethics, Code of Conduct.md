## ==In-scope and Out of scope :==

```Bash
Rule 1: Most Specific domain is the one that should be adhered to,
	Eg:
		- In-Scope: *.example.com
		- Out of Scope: sub.exmaple.com
		
		-> sub.example.com is out of scope; www.example.com is in-scope;
			 another.sub.example.com is in-scope; In-scope: sub.example.com
			 
		- Out of Scope: *.exampler.com
		-> sub.example.com is in-scope; www.example.com is out of scope;
			 another.sub.example.com is out of scope.
			 
Rule 2: Wildcard (*) character appies to none, one or more (without limit)
				subdomains.
		Eg:
			- In-Scope: *.sub.example.com
			-> sub.example.com is in-scope; another.sub.example.com is in-scope;
				 example.com is out of scope.
```
