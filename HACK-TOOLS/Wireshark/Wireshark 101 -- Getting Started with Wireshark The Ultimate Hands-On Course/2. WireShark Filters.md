## 1. What is WireShark Filters ? 

-  **Filters** are rules that let you control what packets you see or capture, helping you focus on the traffic relevant to your analysis. There are two main types:

	1.  **Capture Filters** – Applied _before_ capturing packets, these limit what Wireshark records from the network. For example : 

		-  `tcp port 80` : **now this will only capture HTTP traffic.**

	2.  **isplay Filters** – Applied _after_ capturing, these let you narrow down what’s shown in the packet list without altering the capture file. For example :

		-  `ip.src == 192.168.1.10 && tcp` :  **now this will shows only TCP packets from that IP.**
