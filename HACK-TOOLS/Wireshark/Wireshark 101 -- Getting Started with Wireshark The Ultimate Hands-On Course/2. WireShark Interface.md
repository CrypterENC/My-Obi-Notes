## 1. What are WireShark Profiles ? 

- **Profiles** are customizable workspaces that store your preferred settings, layouts, and filters. Each profile acts like a tailored environment for specific analysis tasks, so you can quickly switch between them without reconfiguring everything. A profile can include **display filter buttons**, **coloring rules**, **column configurations**, **capture settings**, and **protocol preferences**.
