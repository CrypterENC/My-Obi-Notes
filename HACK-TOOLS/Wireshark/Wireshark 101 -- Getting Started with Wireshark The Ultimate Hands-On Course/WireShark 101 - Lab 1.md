#WireShark-Lab-1
## Getting Started with Wireshark - Lab 1  
  
*In this intro lab we will get our hands on Wireshark and try out some basic functions. Don't worry if you don't know the answers right away, part of this exercise is to help you dig for the answers.*
  
**Here are the questions that we will answer:**  
  
### 1. How many packets were captured in this file ?

-  You have *2 ways* to know that : 

1. **First Way :** 

	1.  Goto -> **Statistics tab** -> **Capture File Properties.**

### 3. If you just installed Wireshark for the first time, what profile are you using?  
### 4 Look at packet number 5 - what is the destination IP address in this packet?  
### 5. What is the destination TCP port in this same packet?  
### 6. What application typically uses this port?  
### 7. What TCP flag is set in this packet?  
### 8. What is the frame number of the next packet in this TCP conversation?  
### 9. Can you set a filter for this conversation? How many packets do you get?
