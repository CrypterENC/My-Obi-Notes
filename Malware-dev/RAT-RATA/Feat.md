## Server (Python)

  

- __Interactive console UI__

  - Colorized banner, prompts, and menus (`modules/server_ui_utils.py`, `modules/server_formatings.py`).

  - Startup/shutdown animations, progress indicators.

- __Multi-client management__

  - Accepts and manages multiple TCP clients concurrently (configurable max).

  - Dedicated accept/monitor threads with disconnect handling.

- __Configurable runtime__

  - CLI options: `--ip`, `--port`, `--buffer`, `--max-clients`.

  - Options menu to adjust settings interactively.

  - Configuration persisted to `server_config.json` and loaded on start.

- __Screenshots__

  - Receives and saves screenshots from clients to `screenshots/` with progress display.

- __Formatting and feedback__

  - Rich formatting for system info, network info, processes, logs, and notifications.

  

### Server Main Menu Commands

  

- `start` — Start listener and background threads

- `stop` — Stop listener and disconnect clients

- `list` — List connected clients

- `select <id>` — Enter client command mode for a client

- `clear` — Clear the console

- `options` — Configure server settings (IP, port, buffer, max clients, UI)

- `help` — Show help

- `quit` — Exit

  

## Client (Windows C++)

  

- __Connection__

  - TCP client designed to connect to the server and maintain a session; attempts reconnection if dropped.

- __System information__

  - OS version, CPU/architecture, memory, disk, hostname/username, and network details.

- __Process management__

  - List all processes, search by name, terminate by PID.

- __Installed software__

  - Enumerates installed applications.

- __System logs__

  - Retrieves Windows event logs (System/Application/Security), with count options.

- __Screenshots__

  - Captures and streams screenshots to the server (GDI+/WinAPI based).

- __Application control__

  - Launches applications on the client machine.

- __Keystroke sending__

  - Sends keys to a named process/window.

  

### Client Mode Commands (from server)

  

- Navigation: `back`, `help`, `clear`, `kill`, `exit`

- Information:

  - `sysinfo`

  - `netinfo`

  - `installed_software`

  - `system_logs [type] [count]` (type: System|Application|Security)

- Process management:

  - `list_processes`

  - `search_process [name]`

  - `terminate_process <pid>`

- Actions:

  - `screenshot`

  - `launch_app [name]`

  - `send_keys <process_name> <keys>`

  

## Generator and Binder

  

- __RAT Client Generator (`RAT_Client_Generator/`)__

  - Python-based generator to produce a customized Windows client executable using the C++ source (`rat_clientv1.5.cpp`).

- __RAT Client Binder (`RAT_Client_Binder/`)__

  - Optional binder to combine the client with another application; includes icon extraction/embedding utilities.

  

## Technology & Platform

  

- Server: Python 3.x, `colorama` for UI.

- Client: Windows C++ (WinSock2/WinAPI/GDI+/OLE), built with MinGW-w64 or MSVC.

- Setup: Windows-focused scripts (`install_depen.bat`, `setup_and_run.bat`).

  

## Notes & Considerations

  

- __Security__: No TLS/SSL is currently implemented; traffic is plaintext. Use only on trusted networks or extend with encryption/authentication.

- __Compatibility__: Client is Windows-specific. Server is cross-platform but tuned for Windows terminals.

- __Scalability__: Fixed-size client list by default; configurable `--max-clients`.
